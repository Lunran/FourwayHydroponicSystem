Four-way Hydroponic System
=======================

# What's this?
This is equipment for small-scale hydroponic culture.

- Pictures and images of mechanical parts are available at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:615412

# How can I use it?
You can use this in 4 ways;

1. Reusing an empty can (half-cut).
2. Printing a float and a cup.
3. Reusing an empty can and using LED as a light source.
4. Printing all the parts and using LED as a light source.

- Additionally, you can choose AA battery or USB bus power for the LED power source.

Although this is designed to be put in a living/dining room, you can put one anyware you want.  
Putting something green is a good practice to make your place more comfortable ;)

# What's needed to get one?
1. Print mechanical parts in "Machine" directory with your 3D printer.
  - Choose required parts set depending on your usage.
2. Make an electrical circuit according to the diagram in "Circuit" directory.
  - Instruction is available at http://lunran.sakura.ne.jp/wordpress/en/2015/01/04/%E6%A4%8D%E7%89%A9%E5%B7%A5%E5%A0%B4%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8B%E3%80%80%EF%BD%9E%E9%9B%BB%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%9E%E8%B7%AF%EF%BD%9E/
3. (Preparing a instruction) Put all the mechanical parts and electornic circuit together.
4. (Committing later) Write the program in "Program" directory to your Trinket (Arduino).
5. Ta-dah!
