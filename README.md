# How can I use it?
You can use this in 4 ways;

1. Reusing an empty can (half-cut).
2. Printing a float and a cup.
3. Reusing an empty can and using LED as a light source.
4. Printing all the parts and using LED as a light source.

- Additionally, you can choose AA battery or USB bus power for the LED power source.

Although this is designed to be put in a living/dining room, you can put one anyware you want.  
Putting something green is a good practice to make your place more comfortable ;)

# What's needed to get one?
1. Print mechanical parts in "Machine" directory with your 3D printer.
  - Choose required parts set depending on your usage.
